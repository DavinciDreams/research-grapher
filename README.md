# research-grapher

The goal here is to provide references and citations in an arXiv paper in a GUI friendly node network for easier access as compared to manually going through each reference and searching it through the arXiv webpage.

## TODO:

add a serachbar at the top to insert paper code or arxiv link

mark paper usefull or not and change color baed on that ( store this info in the context)

## BUG

The API data is dirty can't clean it on the fly
