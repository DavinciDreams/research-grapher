`The project is still under development`

# research-grapher

The goal here is to provide references and citations in an arXiv paper in a GUI friendly node network for easier access as compared to manually going through each reference and searching it through the arXiv webpage.

## TODO:

mount API calls to modal buttons (collapse other nodes on the same level to avoid huge unnecessary graphs)

citationVelocity: 591,influentialCitationCount: 498 <--check these tags accordingly the card should have a diffrent color to avoid huge citation generation

mark paper usefull or not and change color baed on that ( store this info in the tree ds)

## BUG

The API data is dirty can't clean it on the fly
