`The project is still under development`

# research-grapher

The goal here is to provide references and citations in an arXiv paper in a GUI friendly node network for easier access as compared to manually going through each reference and searching it through the arXiv webpage.

## TODO:

mark paper usefull or not and change color/icons baed on that ( store this info in the context)

Handle api reponse errors (api has a response for errors just need to mount it to materialize)

Show current paper/selected node paper info on the bottom left

## BUG

The API data is dirty can't clean it on the fly
